# Measurement loger

This project consists of a Python program capable of reading a video as input and then extracting the numbers present, to save in a '.csv' file for data analysis. The idea is to take an analog measurement (as one of a multimeter), record it, and then easily obtain a dataset of the values measured at each frame of the video.
